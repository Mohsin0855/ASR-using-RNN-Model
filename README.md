# Speech-to-Text Model with LJSpeech Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build a speech-to-text model using TensorFlow and the LJSpeech dataset. The model architecture is based on DeepSpeech2 and leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to transcribe spoken words into text.
# Dataset
The LJSpeech dataset contains 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books.
